Back Pocket
Vulfpeck
I know
That it's taken me all this time to say girl
I'm slow
So it's taken me all this time to say girl
Tip toe
And I want to acknowledge my mistake girl
Uh oh
And I hope that you know it's not too late
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
Oh oh oh
And I'll
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my pocket
In my back pocket
And I'll read it when I'm alone
Do you like me? Circle yes or no
On this piece of paper
'Cause I really really need to know
Are you gonna be my fifth grade queen?
Hand it back after second hour
Then I will know if you're gonna be my special flower
Ooh girl, 'cause I need to know
I will
Put it in my pocket
Put it in my pocket
In my back pocketâ€¦
